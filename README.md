# open-ocean

**Free the ocean.**

The free community full system of the ellmos ecosystem.

*[Deutsch](README_de.md)*

> **Private build, and early on purpose.** This repository exists before the system does, so the
> architecture has somewhere to live while it is being decided. It opens when the water reaches
> the ocean — see *[Release conditions](#release-conditions)*.

## Read this first: this repository is a building site

**There is no system here yet.** No installer, no runtime of our own, and deliberately no copies
of the recipes. What is here is the architecture of what is being built: which recipes the system
will consume, where they live, and what the installer has to become.

If you are looking for something usable today, it is the recipe layer — a separate repository
that holds the bundle manifests and releases them wave by wave. The recipes are ready months
before the system that consumes them, which is exactly why they are not in here: a repository
that shipped recipes under the system's name would look finished while the system is not.

| Repository | What it is | State |
|---|---|---|
| **bundles** | the recipe layer: manifests, catalogue, export tool | private, releasing wave by wave |
| **open-ocean** (here) | the system build: architecture, installer, the thing that consumes recipes | private, early |

## The name, and the architecture it carries

The ecosystem names its layers after water, because the metaphor carries the architecture rather
than decorating it:

| Term | What it is |
|---|---|
| **stream / water** | the process itself — data, work, results flowing through everything |
| **Bach / Rinnsal** | the wild, grown streams: the original personal full instance |
| **water pipes** | the same water, tamed and modularised — modules and bundles |
| **waterfall** | the declarative source: the kit, the recipes, the catalogues |
| **ocean** | the full system; the end of the line Bach → Rinnsal → ocean |
| **open-ocean** | the part that belongs to everyone: the free community full system |

The governing rule is a conservation law: **extraction changes the bed, never the water.**
Restructuring must preserve function — "same volume of water" means functional parity. That is
not decoration either; it is the release bar this repository has to clear.

The system is not being written next to the original instance, and the original is not being
rebuilt. It emerges by continued **extraction**: modules flow out of the original, and the
original then wires them back in, replacing its own internals. It does not become a museum piece.
It carries on as a straightened river — no longer entirely natural, but connected to the water
and still supplied.

```

The skeleton references 13 bundles in two rings — the functional core, and breadth around it. It
**references** them: no manifest is copied here. Copies would fork the moment the recipe
repository moves on, and would make this repository look further along than it is.

## Status

**This repository:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Architecture skeleton | present, 13 bundles referenced |
| BACH extraction baseline | present — 114 source-declared names; historic 113-name runtime bar retained; re-audited 2026-08-18 (106 handler classes, +1 vs. the 2026-08-08 baseline — traced to a host-suffixed duplicate file in BACH, `upgrade-WORKSTATION-LG.py` alongside `upgrade.py`; not fixed here, BACH is out of scope for this repository's changes). `registered_names` unchanged at 114. |
| K9-1 data/checkpoint gate | two carrier fixtures green; adapter and BACH equivalence remain open |
| Installer | **all six INSTALLER-TARGET.md steps now built** (2026-08-18) — `tools/resolve_bundles.py` (Resolve+Verify), `tools/fetch_place.py` (Fetch+Place, SHA-pinned, fail-closed), `tools/host_adapters.py` (Activate, read-only check plus write-side activate/rollback), chained by the single entry point `tools/ocean_dev.py` (dry-run default, `--apply` for real writes). See [`architecture/OCEAN-DEV-BUILD-PLAN_2026-08-18.md`](architecture/OCEAN-DEV-BUILD-PLAN_2026-08-18.md) for the staged plan and what remains open (general choice-applier, hosts beyond Claude Code, a real SHA pin to fetch against — the current catalog has none). Run for real against ring 1 on the development host: all 5 bundles verified, 9 of 9 skills activated into a sandboxed target and cleanly rolled back, 13 of 14 modules already present (1 catalog/registry naming mismatch, pre-existing finding). **Not yet run on a machine other than this one** — that is Stage 2 of the build plan, not yet this repository's claim |
| Runtime of our own | **not available** — every candidate is private or only declared |
| Recipes | maintained in the recipe repository, not here |

**The traffic light** — release condition 1 turns green when every referenced bundle is green,
meaning each of its components is public and checked. Scope matters here: this repository's
skeleton references exactly **13** of the ecosystem's ~30 bundles (see [the skeleton](architecture/open-ocean.skeleton.v1.json));
condition 1 is about those 13, not the wider catalog.

| | |
|---|---|
| Bundles referenced by this repository | **13** |
| Of those, components verified public (2026-08-18) | **13 / 13** |
| Unique components checked | 18 modules, 1 access-surface repository (`ellmos-homebase-mcp`), 27 skills (in the public `ellmos-ai/skills` catalog), 1 optional software app (`MediaBrain`) — all confirmed public via live `gh repo view`/catalog lookup, not the modules' own manifest `visibility` field (that field records a target classification and can lag the actual GitHub state) |
| Not applicable to this check | 3 `access_surface` refs to commercial agent providers/subscriptions/APIs (no repository, no public/private state) |

None of the four repositories that blocked *other* parts of the wider ecosystem on 2026-08-08
(`ellmos-core`, plus the three that meanwhile went public — `ellmos-scheduler`, `system-explorer`,
`policy-registry`) are referenced by this repository's 13-bundle skeleton at all; they gate bundles
outside this repository's scope (`core-discovery`, `prompt-workflow`, `runtime-options`,
`governance-assurance`, `automation-control`). Condition 1, read strictly for what this repository
actually references, is met as of 2026-08-18. What still blocks publication is conditions 2 and 3
below, not condition 1.

## Release conditions

This repository carries a conditional publication gate (`PRIVATE.txt`, committed on purpose so
the gate is visible where visibility is switched). It opens when all four are demonstrably met:

1. **Green components** — every referenced bundle is green: each of its components public and
   checked. **Met as of 2026-08-18** for this repository's 13-bundle scope — see the traffic-light
   table above.
2. **Sluice test passed** — the whole line works end to end: a fresh install from these recipes
   reaches a working state on a machine that is not the development host. **Not met yet, but the
   blocker changed on 2026-08-18.** An installer now exists (`tools/ocean_dev.py`, see the status
   table above) and has been proven, with real system data, to Resolve, Verify, Fetch/Place, and
   Activate+Roll back correctly — but only ever run *on this development host*, against a
   deliberately sandboxed target directory, never a genuinely foreign or bare machine. That is
   exactly what a sluice test requires and what has not happened yet: see
   `architecture/OCEAN-DEV-BUILD-PLAN_2026-08-18.md` Stage 2 for the current state of a foreign-host
   run (Mac Studio).
3. **Parity for the release scope** — the system performs at the level it claims to cover. A
   smaller installable core is a build stage, not a release. The current source audit records
   114 reachable names while retaining the historic 113-name runtime snapshot as the minimum
   commitment; see the [extraction roadmap](architecture/BACH-EXTRACTION-ROADMAP.md). **Re-measured
   2026-08-18** (read-only, BACH untouched): the 114-name bar is unchanged and still current; see
   `architecture/bach-parity-baseline.v1.json` → `re_audit_2026-08-18`. This condition asks for more
   than a name count, though: [Cluster 9's operation matrix](architecture/BACH-EXTRACTION-ROADMAP.md#cluster-9-operation-matrix)
   is the only cluster with active work (8 of 9 clusters have not started), and within it 0 of 30
   command names carry `accepted` (functionally-equivalent) status yet — 20 are `candidate-partial`,
   9 are `gap`, 1 is `alias`. Condition 3 is therefore **not close to met**; it depends on the same
   installer/runtime work as condition 2.
4. **Publication check passed** — law, privacy and licensing reviewed with no blockers. **Run
   2026-08-18** (`repo-publish-check` skill, 10 gates) — verdict and local report:
   `.GITHUBBOT/workflows/repo-publish-check/reports/ellmos-ai__open-ocean_2026-08-18.md` (kept
   local per the skill's own rule, not shipped in this repository).

Condition 2 is the one this repository is named after. Opening the sluices and watching whether
the water actually arrives is the test that no amount of correct manifests can substitute for. Of
the four conditions, 1 and 4 are addressed; 2 and 3 both wait on the same missing piece — an
installer and a runtime that do not exist here yet.

## Licence

MIT, chosen by the owner on 2026-08-08 and committed as [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). That settles the
licence part of release condition 4; its law and privacy parts stay open until the publication
check has been run.
